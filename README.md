"# Car-price-prediction" 
Car price prediction using linear regression and Lasso regression in machine learning involves estimating a vehicle's price based on various features like brand, model, mileage, engine capacity, and year of manufacture. Linear regression models the relationship between these features and the car price by finding the best-fit line that minimizes the error between predicted and actual prices. However, when there are too many features or multicollinearity (correlation between features), linear regression can overfit. Lasso regression addresses this by adding an L1 regularization term to the cost function, which penalizes the model for including irrelevant or insignificant features, effectively shrinking some coefficients to zero. This helps in feature selection and creates a more interpretable and robust model. By comparing these techniques, Lasso regression often performs better in scenarios with high-dimensional or noisy data, leading to improved accuracy in predicting car prices.
